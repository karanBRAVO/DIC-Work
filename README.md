In this I have implemented the machine learning concepts.

## How to use???

- Clone this repo

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/karanBRAVO/EMG-Electromyography.git
  ```

Projects

- `p-1`: use the main.ipynb

- `p-2`: use the main.ipynb

- `p-3`: use the final.ipynb

## Features:

- Implemented my own script to handle large datasets.
- Store the models in secondary memory.
- Load it whenever you want and compare with other models.
